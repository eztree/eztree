### Howdy, stranger!

The name's Erin. Some people call me Tree. 🌳 What's your story?

<i>Here's mine, in brief --</i>

I'm an aspiring full stack developer who loves bringing great products to life.

In my past lives, I:
<ul>
  <li>🎥 Took coffee orders for a film crew </li>
  <li>📰 Begged journalists for coverage as a PR executive </li>
  <li>👩🏻‍🌾 Worked on farms in New Zealand</li>
</ul>

Outside of tech, I love to hike and write. Always up for a good story.
